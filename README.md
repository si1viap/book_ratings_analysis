# book_ratings_analysis
This is my first SQL project completely done by myself. I choose a topic that interests me: reading. 
Using Pgadmin I analyzed a dataset of books and the relative ratings given by the readers. 
I highlighted some trends thanks to Pgsql functions like VIEW, CASE, and AGGREGATE FUNCTIONS.
The dataset comes from KAGGLE.
